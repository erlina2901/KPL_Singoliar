This file is a summary of the switches used in the en_GB affix file.
A description of the affix file format is appended to the end of this

In addition to the new suffix and prefix rules a modified TRY list is
used in order to properly find spelling errors in words having . (period)
' (apostrophe) and - (hyphen) within them. A replacement list for common
mis-spellings has also been incorporated.

The en_GB.aff affix file was created from scratch by David Bartlett and 
Andrew Brown.
